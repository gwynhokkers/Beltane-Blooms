#content
I'm Ruth and this is my little corner of the web for all things flowery. I sow, grow and responsibly forage flowers and foliage for dried flower arranging.

I live just outside of Cardiff in South Wales. Click below to find out more about me, my journey and my approach to growing flowers.

title: 'The symbolism of flowers'

## 
#content
Symbolism has long been attached to flowers. An inspiration for folklore, mythology, religion and even inspiring a plant language in Victorian times, flowers are a great gateway for igniting a passion and appreciation for nature.

Universally loved by everyone, it's hard not to fall in love with their different forms, colours and textures. Everlasting flowers capture their fleeting beauty in bloom, transforming and preserving it for months to come.
